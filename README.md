[![](https://skills.thijs.gg/icons?i=java)](https://skills.thijs.gg)

## Description 📝

This repository contains a Java implementation of the Singleton design pattern. The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. In this implementation, the Singleton pattern is applied to create a single instance of a clothing object using the `ClothingSingleton` class.

## Key Components 🔑

1. **Clothing Interface**: Defines the `getClothing` method signature for creating clothing objects.

2. **ClothingSingleton Class**: Implements the `Clothing` interface and ensures only one instance of the `ClothingSingleton` class is created. It provides a static `getInstance` method to access the single instance and a `getClothing` method to print clothing details.

3. **Main Class**: Demonstrates the usage of the `ClothingSingleton` class by obtaining its instance and invoking the `getClothing` method.
